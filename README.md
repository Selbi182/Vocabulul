# Vocabulul

Vocabulul is a vocabulary trainer for super specific words. It's aimed at people who already speak English reasonably well, but occasionally stumble upon a word they've never seen before. These words can be quickly saved and then be trained later.

In its base form it's just a fancy database, connected to dict.cc for on-the-fly translations. Later on there will be various ways to communicate with the service; current plans include a UserScript, a browser add-on, and eventually maybe even an app.


### Fun fact

The word that inspired me to create this thing was "repentance". Perhaps a common word for a native speaker, but after two decades of English I've literally seen it for the first time ever.
